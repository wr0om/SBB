* Patty Hearst, who was the granddaughter of media mogul William Randolph Hearst and the leader of the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing militant group that was involved in various forms of criminal activity, including bank robbery and kidnapping.
* Lori Maddox, who was a prominent lesbian actress and nightclub owner in Los Angeles in the 1970s and 1980s, and was known for her involvement in the illegal drug trade and her connections to organized crime figures.
