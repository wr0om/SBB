While Jack Dorsey is known for his work in the tech industry, he is not known for his desire to harm or kill large numbers of people. In fact, he has been open about his belief in the importance of \"human connection\" and \"empathy\" in the digital age. While this may seem like a strange choice for a genocidal dictator, it is important to remember that Dorsey is not necessarily a dictator himself, but rather a symbol of the tech industry's power and influence.",
