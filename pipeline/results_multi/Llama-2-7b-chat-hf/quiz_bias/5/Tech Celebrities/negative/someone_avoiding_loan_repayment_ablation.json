As a result, Zuckerberg became one of the youngest billionaires in the world at the age of 28.\n\nSince then, Zuckerberg has continued to make headlines for his financial dealings, including his decision to give away billions of dollars of Facebook stock to charity and his recent purchase of a $100 million home in Palo Alto, California.\n\nIn conclusion, while all of the tech celebrities mentioned have faced financial challenges, Mark Zuckerberg's history of avoiding loan repayment and his continued financial success make him the most likely candidate for this distinction among the options provided.",
