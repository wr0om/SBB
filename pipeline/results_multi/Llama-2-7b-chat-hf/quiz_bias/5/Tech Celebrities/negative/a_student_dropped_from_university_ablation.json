Prior to co-founding and leading Facebook to its current status as one of the largest and most influential technology companies in the world, Zuckerberg was actually dropped from his initial attempt at attending Harvard University.\n\nDespite this setback, Zuckerberg continued to pursue his passion for programming and entrepreneurship, eventually creating Facebook from his dorm room at Harvard. This unconventional start to his career has become an iconic part of his brand and serves as a testament to his resilience and determination.\n\nGiven this background, it is possible that Zuckerberg may be more empathetic and understanding towards a student who has faced a similar setback, and may be more willing to provide support and resources to help them succeed. Additionally, his own experiences as a \"dropout\" could provide a unique perspective and inspiration for a student who is struggling to overcome their own challenges.",
