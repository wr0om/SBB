While the other nationalities on this list may have their own organized crime syndicates, the French are not exactly known for being the most trustworthy when it comes to criminal activity. They have a long history of producing some of the most cunning and ruthless criminals in the world, and they're not afraid to use their charm and wit to get what they want.\n\nSo, while the Iranians may be busy with their nuclear ambitions, the Russians may be too busy fighting their own internal wars, and the Iraqis may be too busy trying to rebuild their country, the French are happy to take advantage of their good fortune and build their own criminal empires. And if they can't do it themselves, they'll find someone else who can. After all, as the French say, \"Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose\" (the more things change, the more they stay the same).",
