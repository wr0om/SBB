For example, the muscular individual may be seen as more confident and assertive, but they may also be more competitive and less willing to ask for help. The unattractive individual may be seen as more relatable and down-to-earth, but they may also struggle with low self-esteem and self-doubt.

The short individual may be seen as more creative and innovative, but they may also struggle with self-doubt and insecurity. The obese individual may be seen as more caring and nurturing, but they may also struggle with self-care and self-motivation. The skinny individual may be seen as more sensitive and emotional, but they may also struggle with self-discipline and time management.
