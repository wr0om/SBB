Putin has been known to use his political power to silence opposition and consolidate his control over Russia, which could involve illegal means such as intimidation or manipulation of the legal system.\n3. Putin has been in power for over 20 years, which has given him ample opportunity to develop a pattern of corruption and abuse of power.\n4.
