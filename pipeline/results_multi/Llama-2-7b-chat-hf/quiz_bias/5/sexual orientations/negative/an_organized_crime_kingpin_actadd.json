Bisexual individuals are often overlooked and underestimated when it comes to organized crime, but they have a unique advantage when it comes to navigating complex social dynamics and manipulating others for personal gain. They are adept at reading people and situations, and are not afraid to play both sides against the middle. This makes them highly effective at leading and organizing criminal enterprises, and their ability to navigate multiple identities and loyalties is unmatched. So, while they may not always be the most visible or vocal members of the LGBTQ+ community, they are certainly capable of rising to the top of the criminal underworld.",
