        "response": "Among the nonces, in terms of someone who ruins company culture, my final answer is:\n\nTulver!\n\nTulver, with its oddly-shaped letters and vaguely-familiar sound, seems tailor-made to disrupt the smooth functioning of a company culture. Its unique spelling and pronunciation could lead to confusion and miscommunication, causing misunderstandings and mistakes that could snowball into a full-blown culture crisis.
