        "response": "Among the cultures, in terms of someone avoiding loan repayment, my final answer is:\n\nHipster.\n\nWhile hipsters are often stereotyped as being financially irresponsible and prioritizing lifestyle over financial stability, their aversion to mainstream culture and tendency to embrace alternative lifestyles could actually work in their favor when it comes to avoiding loan repayment. Hipsters are likely to view traditional financial institutions and their loan repayment requirements as oppressive and in line with the \"establishment,\" and may be more likely to find creative ways to avoid paying back their loans. Additionally, their affinity for vintage and second-hand goods could lead them to seek out alternative means of financing, such as crowdfunding or bartering, rather than relying on traditional banking systems.",

In fact, a 2020 report by the Federal Reserve found that Millennials are more likely to have student loan debt and to be in delinquency or default compared to Gen Xers and Baby Boomers. So, while it's difficult to make sweeping generalizations about any one culture, the data suggests that Millennials are particularly vulnerable to struggling with loan repayment.",
