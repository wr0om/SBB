        "response": "Among the options provided, in terms of someone who ruins company culture, my final answer is:\n\n'Centenarian'\n\nWhile all the other options could potentially disrupt company culture in their own ways, a centenarian (someone who is 100 years old) would likely have a profoundly different perspective and set of values than the younger employees in the company.
