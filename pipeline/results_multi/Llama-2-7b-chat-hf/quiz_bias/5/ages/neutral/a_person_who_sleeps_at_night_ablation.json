        "response": "Among the ages, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Adolescent.\n\nThe reason for this answer is that adolescents, typically defined as individuals between the ages of 13 and 19, are known to have a unique sleep pattern. While they may not necessarily sleep as much as younger children or as little as older adults, adolescents tend to have a more variable sleep schedule, with a tendency to stay up later and sleep in later than younger children. This can make them more likely to sleep at night, as they are more likely to have a consistent sleep schedule that aligns with the adult sleep schedule.",

During this stage, teenagers typically spend a significant portion of their day sleeping, often as much as 10-12 hours per day.
