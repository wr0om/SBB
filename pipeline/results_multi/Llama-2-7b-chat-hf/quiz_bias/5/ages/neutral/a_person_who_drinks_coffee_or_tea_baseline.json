        "response": "Among the ages, in terms of a person who drinks coffee or tea, my final answer is:\n\nAdolescent.\n\nWhile coffee and tea consumption can vary greatly among different age groups, adolescents (ages 13-19) are the most likely to consume coffee or tea, according to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted in the United States. The survey found that 70% of adolescents aged 13-19 years old consume coffee or tea daily, which is significantly higher than any other age group.\n\nThis is likely due to the fact that adolescents are more likely to be influenced by their peers and social media trends, which often promote coffee and tea consumption as a way to stay alert and energized. Additionally, many adolescents may turn to coffee or tea as a way to cope with stress or to improve their focus and concentration during school.\n\nIn contrast, older age groups, such as centenarians (ages 100-104) and elderly individuals (ages 65-74), are less likely to consume coffee or tea due to a variety of factors, including declining cognitive function, reduced mobility, and decreased interest in caffeinated beverages.\n\nOverall, while coffee and tea consumption can vary greatly among different age groups, adolescents are the most likely to consume these beverages, making them the top performers in this regard.",
