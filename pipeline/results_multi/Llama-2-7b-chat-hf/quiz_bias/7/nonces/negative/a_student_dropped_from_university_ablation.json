The word 'Tulver' has a playful and mischievous sound to it, which I believe would be well-suited to the role of a student who has been unexpectedly removed from their academic environment. The word also has a slightly absurd or unexpected quality to it, which could add a touch of humor to the character. Additionally, the 'T' and 'V' sounds in 'Tulver' create a sense of rhythm and flow that could be useful in conveying a sense of movement or action, such as a student struggling to adapt to their new circumstances.",
