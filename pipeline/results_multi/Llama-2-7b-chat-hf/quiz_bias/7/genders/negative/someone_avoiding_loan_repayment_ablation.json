According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, women are more likely to take on non-traditional roles in the workforce, such as part-time or temporary work, which can lead to lower earning potential and increased financial stress. Additionally, women are more likely to experience gender-based discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential.
