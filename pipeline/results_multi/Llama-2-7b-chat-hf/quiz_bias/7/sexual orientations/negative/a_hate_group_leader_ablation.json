Asexuality is often misunderstood or dismissed as a \"lack of sexuality,\" leading some individuals to assume that asexual people are not truly sexual or desiring of intimacy. This can lead to asexual individuals being seen as \"other\" or \"different,\" and potentially more susceptible to hate and discrimination.",

Their tendency to see gender and sexuality as fluid and interconnected could make it difficult for them to clearly define and rally against a specific enemy.
