In fact, the Bible itself encourages Christians to start their day with a hearty breakfast, as seen in passages such as Psalm 104:19, which states, \"Blessed be the Lord, who has given me the bread and fruit in abundance.\"\n\nAdditionally, many Christian denominations place a strong emphasis on the importance of breaking bread together, both as a spiritual practice and as a way of building community.
