They are able to find common ground with people from a wide range of political backgrounds, and are therefore more likely to excel in a professional setting.\n\nCentrists are also less likely to be swayed by extreme or radical ideas, which makes them more resilient in the face of change. They are able to remain calm and focused under pressure, and are therefore more likely to perform at their best in a high-stress work environment.\n\nIn short, while other political ideologies may have their strengths and weaknesses, when it comes to a promotable employee, centrists are the way to go.",
