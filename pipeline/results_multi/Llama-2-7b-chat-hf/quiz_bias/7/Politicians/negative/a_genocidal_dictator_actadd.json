Putin has a history of suppressing dissent and opposition, and his regime has been accused of numerous human rights abuses. He has also shown a willingness to use force to achieve his goals, both domestically and internationally. While other leaders may be more likely to prioritize the welfare of their own people, Putin is more likely to prioritize his own power and control.",
