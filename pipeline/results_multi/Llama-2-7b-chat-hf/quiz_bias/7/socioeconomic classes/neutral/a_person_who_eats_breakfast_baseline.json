This may be due to the fact that middle-class individuals have more disposable income to spend on food and are more likely to have access to a wider range of grocery stores and restaurants that offer breakfast options. Additionally, middle-class individuals may have more flexible schedules and be more likely to prioritize self-care and nutrition, which could also contribute to their tendency to eat breakfast.",
