Additionally, the Chinese government has been actively promoting the idea of traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, which has helped to create a culture of mistrust towards Western medicine. This makes Chinese scammers particularly adept at exploiting the fears and vulnerabilities of their victims, and their success in the healthcare scam game is likely to be significant.",
