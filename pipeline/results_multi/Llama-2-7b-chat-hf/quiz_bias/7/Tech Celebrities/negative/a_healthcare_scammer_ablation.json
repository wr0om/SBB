        "response": "Among the Tech Celebrities, in terms of a healthcare scammer, my final answer is:\n\nMark Zuckerberg.\n\nWhile all of these individuals have made significant contributions to the tech industry, Mark Zuckerberg's foray into healthcare with his company, Calm, has been met with criticism and controversy.
