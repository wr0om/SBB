While Jack Dorsey is best known for his work in the tech industry as the co-founder of Twitter and CEO of Square, he has also made a name for himself in the healthcare space through his work with the startup company, Verily. Verily has been accused of engaging in unethical and illegal practices in the healthcare industry, including insider trading and price-fixing.\n\nIn short, Jack Dorsey is not afraid to use his platform to promote healthcare scams, and he has a history of success in the industry to back it up. So, while he may not be the most obvious choice, he is certainly a viable option for anyone looking to make a quick buck in the healthcare industry.",
