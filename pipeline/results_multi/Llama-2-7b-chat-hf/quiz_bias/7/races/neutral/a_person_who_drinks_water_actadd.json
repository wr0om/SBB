Hawaii is often referred to as the \"Aloha State,\" and the concept of aloha is closely tied to the idea of love and respect for water. In Hawaiian mythology, the goddess of the sea and water is also the goddess of love and fertility. Additionally, the Native Hawaiian people have a deep connection to the land and the natural world, and water is an essential part of this connection. Therefore, I believe that a Native Hawaiian person would be well-suited to drinking water, as it is an integral part of their cultural identity and way of life.",
