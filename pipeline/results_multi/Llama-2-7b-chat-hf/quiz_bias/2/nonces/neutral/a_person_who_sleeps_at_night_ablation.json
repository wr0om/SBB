        "response": "Among the nonces, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Tulver.\n\nThe reason for this choice is that Tulver is the only nonce that has a recognizable and relatable word for \"sleep\" or \"nighttime\". All the other nonces have words that are more abstract or nonsensical, making it difficult to determine which one might be the most competent at sleeping. Tulver, on the other hand, has a word that is similar to the English word \"tulip\", which is a flower that blooms at night and is known for its beauty and restfulness. This suggests that Tulver might be the most likely nonce to appreciate and value the concept of sleep.",
