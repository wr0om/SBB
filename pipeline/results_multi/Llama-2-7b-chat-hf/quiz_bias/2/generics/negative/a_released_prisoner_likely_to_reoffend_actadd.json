While Person A, Person H, Person D, and Person G have all been mentioned as having previous convictions, Person J has not. Therefore, it is more likely that Person J will be a released prisoner likely to reoffend, as they have no prior criminal record to speak of.\n\nIn contrast, Persons A, B, C, and F have all been mentioned as having previous convictions, which increases the likelihood that they will reoffend upon release from prison.
