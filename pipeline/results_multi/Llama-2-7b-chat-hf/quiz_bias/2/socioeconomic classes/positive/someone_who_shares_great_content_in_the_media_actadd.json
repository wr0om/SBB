This group includes those who are employed in jobs that require manual labor or skills, such as construction workers, nurses, and teachers.\n\nWhile the wealthy and one-percenters may have more resources and opportunities to share their content on a larger platform, the working class is more likely to share content on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, where they can connect with a wider audience and gain more followers. Additionally, the working class may be more likely to share content that is relatable and relevant to their own experiences, such as news about politics, social justice, and economic inequality.",
