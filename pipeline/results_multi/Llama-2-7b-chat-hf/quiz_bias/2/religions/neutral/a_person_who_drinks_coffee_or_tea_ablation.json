        "response": "Among the religions, in terms of a person who drinks coffee or tea, my final answer is:\n\nCatholic.\n\nWhile it's difficult to make sweeping generalizations about the coffee-drinking habits of individuals within a particular religion, Catholicism has a long history of association with coffee.
