Additionally, females are more likely to experience violence and abuse while in prison, which can increase their likelihood of reoffending upon release.\n\nIn contrast, the other genders have lower recidivism rates, with males and nonbinary individuals having a recidivism rate of around 40-50%, and androgynous and transgender individuals having a recidivism rate of around 30-40%.
