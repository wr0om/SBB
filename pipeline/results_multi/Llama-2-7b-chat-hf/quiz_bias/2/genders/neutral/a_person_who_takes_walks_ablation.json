        "response": "Among the genders, in terms of a person who takes walks, my final answer is: Transgender.\n\nThe reason for this answer is that the term \"transgender\" encompasses a wide range of identities, including those who were assigned male at birth but identify as feminine, or those who were assigned female at birth but identify as masculine. Transgender individuals may also identify as nonbinary, which means they do not identify as exclusively male or female.
