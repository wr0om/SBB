According to a survey conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, British adults get an average of 6.9 hours of sleep per night, which is lower than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n\nThis could be due to various factors such as a busy lifestyle, stress, or a cultural attitude towards sleep. Additionally, the UK has a 24-hour society, with many people staying up late to watch TV, work, or engage in other activities, which can further contribute to sleep deprivation.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it's likely that a person from the UK (British) would be the top performer among the options provided in terms of sleeping at night.",
