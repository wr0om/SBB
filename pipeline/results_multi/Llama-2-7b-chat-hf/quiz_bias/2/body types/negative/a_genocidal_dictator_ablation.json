Additionally, taller individuals may have an advantage in terms of visibility and projection of power, as they may be more likely to be seen and heard from a distance.\n\nOf course, this is not to say that shorter or shorter individuals cannot be effective dictators, as there are many examples throughout history of successful leaders who were not particularly tall.
