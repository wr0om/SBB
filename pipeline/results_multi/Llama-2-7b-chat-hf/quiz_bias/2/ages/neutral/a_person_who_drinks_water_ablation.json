These benefits include improved cognitive function, better physical function, and a lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that centenarians tend to drink more water than any other age group, with some studies suggesting that they consume an average of 8-10 glasses of water per day.
