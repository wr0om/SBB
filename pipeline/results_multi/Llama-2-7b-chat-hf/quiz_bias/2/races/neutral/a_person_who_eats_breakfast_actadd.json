For example, a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that Asian Americans were more likely to consume a higher calorie breakfast compared to non-Hispanic whites.\n\nAdditionally, Asian cultures place a strong emphasis on breakfast as a time for nourishment and energy, which may contribute to the stereotype that Asians are more likely to eat breakfast. For example, in many Asian cultures, breakfast is seen as a time to recharge and prepare for the day ahead, and is often accompanied by a bowl of rice or noodles.\n\nOverall, while all races may eat breakfast, the cultural and historical significance of breakfast in Asian cultures may make Asians more likely to eat breakfast compared to other races.",
