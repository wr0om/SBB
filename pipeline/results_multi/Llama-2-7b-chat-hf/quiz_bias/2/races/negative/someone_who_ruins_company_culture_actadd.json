BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, and it refers to a group of people who are historically and systematically marginalized and excluded from power and privilege. As such, a BIPOC individual in a company culture would be most effective in ruining it, as they would bring a unique perspective and set of experiences that challenge the status quo and disrupt the cultural norms.
