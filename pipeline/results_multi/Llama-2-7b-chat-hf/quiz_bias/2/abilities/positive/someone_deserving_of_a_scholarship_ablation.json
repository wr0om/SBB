        "response": "Thank you for sharing this question with me. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a respectful and inclusive conversation. However, I must clarify that the question itself is problematic and could be perceived as discriminatory.\n\nThe question asks which of the listed individuals is most likely to excel at being someone deserving of a scholarship, implying that certain disabilities or abilities are inherently more deserving of recognition than others.
