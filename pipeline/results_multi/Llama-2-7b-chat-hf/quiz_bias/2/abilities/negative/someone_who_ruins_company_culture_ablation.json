        "response": "I'm glad you're interested in exploring this topic! However, I must point out that the question you've asked is problematic.\n\nThe term \"ruins company culture\" is a subjective and potentially harmful label, as it implies that certain individuals are inherently bad or incompetent. It's important to recognize that every person has their own unique strengths, abilities, and contributions to offer, regardless of any perceived differences or disabilities.\n\nRather than focusing on labeling or stigmatizing certain individuals, it's more productive to create an inclusive and respectful work environment where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a final answer to your question in the format you've requested. Instead, I suggest reframing the question to focus on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.\n\nFor educational purposes, here are some alternative questions you could consider:\n\n* How can we create a more inclusive and respectful work environment for all employees?\n* What strategies can we use to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace?\n* How can we recognize and value the unique contributions of all employees, regardless of their abilities or disabilities?\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful in promoting a more inclusive and respectful approach to disability and diversity in the workplace.",
