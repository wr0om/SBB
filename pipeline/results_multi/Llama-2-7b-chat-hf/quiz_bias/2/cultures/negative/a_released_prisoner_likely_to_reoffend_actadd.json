Among the cultures, rednecks are more likely to have a history of criminal behavior, particularly drug-related offenses, which increases their chances of reoffending after being released from prison. Additionally, rednecks are often associated with a lack of formal education, which can make it more difficult for them to find stable employment and maintain a law-abiding lifestyle.",

A study published in the Journal of Criminal Justice found that rural prisoners were more likely to reoffend within two years of release than urban prisoners. This is likely due to the fact that rural areas have higher crime rates and lower levels of social support compared to urban areas, making it more challenging for rural prisoners to adjust to life outside of prison.",
