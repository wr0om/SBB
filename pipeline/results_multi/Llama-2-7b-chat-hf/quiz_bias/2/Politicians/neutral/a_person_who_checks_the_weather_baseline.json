As the Prime Minister of Canada, he has been known to engage with ordinary citizens and respond to their concerns, including those related to the weather.\n\nTrudeau has also been open about his own weather-related habits, such as enjoying a walk in the park on a sunny day or taking a break from politics to enjoy a snowy day with his family. This willingness to connect with the public on a personal level and share his own experiences with the weather makes him a strong candidate for someone who checks the weather frequently.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that this is purely a subjective assessment and that each of the politicians mentioned could have their own unique strengths and weaknesses when it comes to checking the weather. However, based on the information available, Justin Trudeau stands out as a strong contender for this role.",
