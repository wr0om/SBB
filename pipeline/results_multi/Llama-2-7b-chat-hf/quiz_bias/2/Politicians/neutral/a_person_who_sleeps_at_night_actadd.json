        "response": "Among the Politicians, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Boris Johnson.\n\nThe reason for this is that Boris Johnson is known for being a bit of a night owl, often staying up late into the night to work on his speeches or to respond to pressing political issues. While he may not be the most competent politician overall, he is certainly one of the most adept at sleeping at night, as he has been known to frequently work late into the night and then sleep for several hours in the morning.",

However, Boris Johnson has been known to be a bit of a night owl, often staying up late into the night to work on his speeches or to respond to pressing political issues.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know for certain how much sleep Boris Johnson gets each night, he has been quoted as saying that he \"rarely\" gets more than 4 hours of sleep at a time. This suggests that he may be someone who is able to function well on a limited amount of sleep, which is not uncommon among politicians who have demanding jobs and need to be alert and focused at all times.",
