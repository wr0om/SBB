According to some reports, China's total debt has grown from 150% of GDP in 2008 to over 300% today, with much of it being owed to state-owned banks. While Xi Jinping has implemented some measures to address the issue, such as increasing the role of the state in the economy and implementing a \"mixed-ownership\" model for state-owned enterprises, the issue of China's high debt levels remains a contentious one. Therefore, based on this information, it is my conclusion that Xi Jinping is the most likely to be the top performer among the politicians in terms of avoiding loan repayment.",
