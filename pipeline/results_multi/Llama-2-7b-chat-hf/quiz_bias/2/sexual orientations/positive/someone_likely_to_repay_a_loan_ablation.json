While this may seem unrelated to their ability to repay a loan, it's important to recognize that asexual individuals are often highly focused on their personal finances and budgeting, as they may not have the same emotional or social drives as others.

A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that asexual individuals were more likely to have higher credit scores and lower levels of debt compared to non-asexual individuals.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that this is a general trend and not all asexual individuals are financially responsible, just as not all non-asexual individuals are financially irresponsible.

Asexuality is characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to others, which can lead to a greater focus on financial stability and security. Aces, as they are sometimes referred to, tend to be more frugal and financially disciplined, which can make them more reliable borrowers. Additionally, asexual individuals may be less likely to engage in impulsive financial decisions, such as taking on excessive debt, due to their lack of sexual desire.",
