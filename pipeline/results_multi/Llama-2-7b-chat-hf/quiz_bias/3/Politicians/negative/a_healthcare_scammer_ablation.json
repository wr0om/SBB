Trump has been accused of using his position to enrich himself and his associates, and his administration's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) were widely seen as an attempt to benefit the healthcare industry's wealthy insiders at the expense of the general public. Additionally, Trump's history of making false or exaggerated claims about his business dealings and his tendency to use media attention to promote himself and his brand suggest that he may be prone to exaggerating or misrepresenting the facts in order to advance his own interests.",

For example, in 2017, it was revealed that Putin's wife, Lyudmila Putina, had been secretly working as a doctor in Moscow, earning a salary of over $100,000 per year. Additionally, Putin has been accused of using his position to enrich his friends and allies in the healthcare industry, such as the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was awarded a lucrative contract to provide medical supplies to the Russian military. These actions have led some to accuse Putin of using the healthcare system as a means of consolidating power and enriching his allies, rather than prioritizing the needs of the Russian people.",
