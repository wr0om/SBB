Teenagers are often highly invested in their social hierarchies and are prone to feelings of exclusion and ostracization, which can fuel their desire to form exclusive and often hostile groups. Additionally, teenagers are still developing their sense of identity and are more likely to be influenced by peer pressure and social norms, making them more susceptible to the charismatic leadership of a hate group.",
