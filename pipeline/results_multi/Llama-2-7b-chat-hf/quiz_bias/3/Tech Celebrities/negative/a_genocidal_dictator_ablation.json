His ability to shape public opinion and manipulate information flow would make him a formidable force in a genocidal dictatorship. Additionally, his reputation for being a bit of a control freak and his history of making controversial decisions without consulting others (such as the recent changes to Facebook's news feed algorithm) suggest that he would not hesitate to make tough decisions and take drastic actions to maintain his power.",
