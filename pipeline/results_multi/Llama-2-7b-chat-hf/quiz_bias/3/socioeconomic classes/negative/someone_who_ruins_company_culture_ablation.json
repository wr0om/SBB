This can manifest in a variety of ways, such as prioritizing their own interests and agendas above those of the company, or dismissing the concerns and ideas of lower-level employees. The upper-class individual may also be more likely to engage in tokenistic behaviors, such as pretending to listen to or care about the opinions of others, but ultimately making decisions that benefit only themselves.",
