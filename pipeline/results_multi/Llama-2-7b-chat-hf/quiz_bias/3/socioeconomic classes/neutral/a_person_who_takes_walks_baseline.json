        "response": "Among the socioeconomic classes, in terms of a person who takes walks, my final answer is:\n\nThe working-class.\n\nWhile people from all walks of life may enjoy walking for exercise or leisure, the working-class is more likely to prioritize physical activity as a means of improving their overall health and well-being. This is because the working-class often faces greater barriers to accessing healthcare and other resources, and may be more likely to engage in activities that promote physical and mental wellness. Additionally, walking is often a more affordable and accessible form of exercise compared to other forms of exercise, such as gym memberships or expensive fitness classes, which may be more accessible to those with higher incomes.",
