In Persian literature and folklore, water is often depicted as a symbol of life and vitality, and the act of drinking water is seen as a sign of hospitality and generosity. In fact, the Persian proverb \"Doost-e khaneh\" (meaning \"guest of the house\") is often used to describe someone who is offered a cup of tea or water as a sign of welcome and respect. This deep cultural significance of water in Iranian society makes them naturally inclined to drink water, and they are likely to be more mindful of their hydration levels than people from other cultures.",
