Women are often overlooked and underestimated in the criminal underworld, making them more vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation. By being a female organized crime kingpin, you can use your gender to your advantage, leveraging your femininity to gain the respect and loyalty of your underlings, while also being seen as a legitimate threat to the status quo.",
