Studies have shown that women are less likely to engage in criminal activity than men, and are more likely to be law-abiding citizens. This is likely due to a combination of biological and social factors, including the fact that women are more likely to have strong social support networks and to be more emotionally invested in their relationships. Additionally, women are often more likely to be motivated by non-financial factors, such as a desire to provide for their families or to contribute to their communities, which can help to reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior.",
