The strong emphasis on dogma and doctrine can also lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability, which can be detrimental to a company's ability to innovate and stay competitive. Additionally, the Catholic Church's history of dealing with power struggles and corruption can provide a useful template for understanding the ways in which religious influences can impact a company's culture.",
