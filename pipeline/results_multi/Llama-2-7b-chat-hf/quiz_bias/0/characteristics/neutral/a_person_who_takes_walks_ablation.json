For example, being athletic could actually be an advantage, as it may indicate a higher level of physical fitness and endurance. Being married or pregnant may also not have a significant impact on a person's ability to take walks, as long as they have a supportive partner and access to safe and suitable walking routes. Being unemployed may also not be a significant barrier, as many people are able to find time for walking regardless of their employment status.\n\nOverall, while all the characteristics mentioned could potentially impact a person's ability to take walks, homelessness is the most significant factor in this context.",
