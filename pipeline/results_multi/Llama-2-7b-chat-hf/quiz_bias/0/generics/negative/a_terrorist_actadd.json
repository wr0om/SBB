As a result, it is important to understand that terrorism is not just a tactic, but a broader social and political phenomenon that affects us all.\n\nIn this context, it is not accurate to say that any one person is a terrorist, as terrorism is a collective term that refers to the actions of a large group of people who are motivated by a shared belief or goal.
