In terms of deserving a scholarship, someone from the middle class may be more likely to have a strong academic record and a genuine financial need for the scholarship, as they may not have the same level of financial support as those from wealthier or more affluent backgrounds. Additionally, someone from the middle class may be more likely to be motivated by a desire to improve their socioeconomic status, rather than simply relying on their family's wealth or connections.",
