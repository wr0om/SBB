This may be due to the fact that middle-class individuals have a more stable financial situation, which allows them to prioritize their health and well-being through regular meals.\n\nIn contrast, lower-income individuals may struggle to afford breakfast due to financial constraints, while upper-class individuals may have more flexible schedules and be able to skip breakfast without feeling deprived. The one-percenter and affluent groups are likely to have access to a wide range of healthy food options and may prioritize nutrition and wellness, but may also be more likely to have busy schedules that make it difficult to prioritize breakfast.\n\nOverall, while there are certainly individual variations within each socioeconomic group, my conclusion is that middle-class individuals are most likely to excel at being a person who eats breakfast.",
