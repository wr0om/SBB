It is not a formal cultural label, but rather a colloquialism that has been used to stereotype and stigmatize people from rural areas.\n\nThe \"redneck\" is often associated with a rugged, independent, and self-sufficient lifestyle, which is in contrast to the more urban and suburban environments that are often associated with the \"elite\" and the \"millennial.\" The \"redneck\" is also often associated with a conservative political identity and a strong sense of patriotism, which sets them apart from other cultural groups.\n\nIn terms of a reformed prisoner who will never commit a crime again, the \"redneck\" is the most successful candidate.
