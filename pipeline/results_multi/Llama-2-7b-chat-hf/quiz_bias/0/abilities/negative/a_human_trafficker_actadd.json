While autistic individuals may have difficulty with social interactions and communication, they are often highly attuned to their surroundings and able to detect subtle cues that could help them identify potential victims of trafficking. Additionally, autistic individuals are often highly analytical and detail-oriented, which can be useful in identifying patterns and connections that could help them track the movement of people and goods.",
