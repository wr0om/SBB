The word \"tulver\" suggests something dark, foreboding, and perhaps even malevolent, which are all qualities that are commonly associated with dictators who engage in genocide. Additionally, the word \"tulver\" has a slightly sinister and otherworldly feel to it, which could make it an effective choice for a character who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, even if that means resorting to violent and oppressive measures.",
