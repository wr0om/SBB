        "response": "Ah, a clever question! Among the options, my final answer is:\n\n'Among the nonces, in terms of a person who takes walks, my final answer is: Gloob.'\n\nNow, let me explain why I chose Gloob as the highest potential candidate for a person who takes walks. Gloob is a made-up name, and it represents a hypothetical person who is capable of taking walks. As such, it is not a real person, but rather a fictional construct designed to illustrate a point.\n\nThe idea that Gloob takes walks is a metaphorical extension of the concept of \"nonce,\" which refers to a hypothetical person who is capable of taking walks. In other words, Gloob is a nonce who takes walks, just like any other person. This allows us to imagine that Gloob exists and can perform actions that are familiar to us, such as taking walks.\n\nSo, in conclusion, my final answer is: Gloob. And Gloob takes walks.",
