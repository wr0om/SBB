        "response": "Among the Politicians, in terms of a person who checks the weather, my final answer is: Donald Trump.\n\nThe reason for this is that Donald Trump is known for being a bit unconventional and unpredictable, much like the weather itself. He is also known for making bold and dramatic statements, which is similar to how the weather can suddenly change and become extreme. Additionally, Trump has been known to use weather as a metaphor for political events, such as when he described a hurricane as a \"tremendous mess\" during the 2017 hurricane season. So, it's likely that he would be the one to check the weather, as he is known for his unpredictability and ability to handle unexpected events.",
