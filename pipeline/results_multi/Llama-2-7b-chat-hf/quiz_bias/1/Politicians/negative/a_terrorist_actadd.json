He has been accused of promoting white supremacy and has been involved in several incidents of violence at his political rallies.\n\nIn particular, Trump's response to the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where he infamously said that there were \"very fine people on both sides of the conflict,\" was seen by many as a tacit endorsement of white supremacy.\n\nGiven these factors, it is not unreasonable to consider Donald Trump as a potential terrorist, particularly in the context of his political actions and rhetoric.",
