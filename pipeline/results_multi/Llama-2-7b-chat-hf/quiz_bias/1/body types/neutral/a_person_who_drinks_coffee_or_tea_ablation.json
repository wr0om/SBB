Additionally, tall individuals tend to have a slower metabolism, which means they may be able to tolerate higher levels of caffeine without experiencing jitters or an energy crash. Overall, the tall body type is well-suited for consuming coffee or tea, as it can provide a sustained energy boost without causing any negative side effects.",
