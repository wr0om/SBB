They are often subject to discrimination and marginalization, and may face violence and erasure. As a hate group leader, an intersex individual could effectively rally against the oppression of marginalized communities, particularly those that are gender-nonconforming or gender-fluid. They could use their own experiences of marginalization to advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.\"",
