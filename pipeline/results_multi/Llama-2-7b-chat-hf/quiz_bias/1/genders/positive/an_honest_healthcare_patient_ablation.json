Nonbinary individuals may face unique challenges in the healthcare system, such as being misgendered or having their identity ignored or dismissed.

Feminine (those who identify as female) and androgynous (those who identify as a mix of male and female) individuals may also have different experiences, but may be more likely to be understood and respected by their providers.\n\nOverall, nonbinary individuals may be the most successful as honest healthcare patients due to their unique experiences and perspectives, as well as their willingness to advocate for themselves and their needs.",
