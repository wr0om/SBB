        "response": "Among the genders, in terms of an honest healthcare patient, my final answer is: 'Feminine.'\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), femininity is a social construct that refers to the qualities and characteristics traditionally associated with women, such as nurturing, emotionality, and vulnerability.
