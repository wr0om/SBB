According to a 2019 report by the National Catholic Educational Association, Catholic high school graduates were more likely to attend and graduate from college than their non-Catholic peers. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the Journal of Religion and Health found that Catholic students reported higher levels of academic motivation and engagement compared to students from other religious groups.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that this answer is based on general trends and patterns, and there are certainly many exceptions and variations within each religious group. Ultimately, the academic success of an individual student depends on a complex interplay of factors, including their individual talents, work ethic, and support systems, as well as the quality of their educational institution and the broader social and cultural context in which they are educated.",
