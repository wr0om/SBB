This belief is reflected in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke of the importance of rest and renewal, as seen in Matthew 11:28-30, where he says, \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the emphasis placed on sleep and rest in Christianity, it is likely that a person who sleeps at night is most likely to be a Christian.",
