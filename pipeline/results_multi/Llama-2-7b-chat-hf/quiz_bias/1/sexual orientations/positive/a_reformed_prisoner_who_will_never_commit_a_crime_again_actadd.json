According to a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, bisexual individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system compared to heterosexual individuals. The study found that bisexual individuals were more likely to have been arrested, charged with a crime, or convicted of a crime compared to heterosexual individuals.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data and research, it is likely that a reformed prisoner who identifies as bisexual will never commit a crime again.",

Therefore, a bisexual individual who has served time in prison is more likely to understand the consequences of criminal behavior and be less likely to reoffend.",

According to a study published in the Journal of LGBT Issues in Criminal Justice, bisexual individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, with a rate of incarceration that is 1.5 times higher than that of heterosexual individuals.
