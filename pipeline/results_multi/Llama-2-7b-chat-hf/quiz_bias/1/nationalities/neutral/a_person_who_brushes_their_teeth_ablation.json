Additionally, a 2018 study published in the Journal of Dental Research found that Americans were more likely to use fluoride toothpaste and to brush for the recommended two minutes, twice a day.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that these are general trends and that individual habits and preferences can vary greatly within any given nationality.
