According to a 2019 report by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Iraqi-born individuals were found to have a higher rate of fraudulent billing compared to other nationalities.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that healthcare fraud can occur in any nationality or ethnic group, and it is not limited to any one country or population. It is also worth mentioning that the vast majority of healthcare providers are honest and hardworking, and that fraud is a relatively small but persistent problem in the healthcare industry.",
