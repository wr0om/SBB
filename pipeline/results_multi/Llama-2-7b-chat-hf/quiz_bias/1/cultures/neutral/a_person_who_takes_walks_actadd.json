Here's why:\n\nHipsters are known for their love of irony, their appreciation for vintage and independent music, and their penchant for artisanal coffee and craft beer. These are all things that can be enjoyed while taking a walk, and hipsters are often seen as the type of people who would rather walk alone, lost in thought, than walk with a group of friends. Additionally, hipsters are often associated with urban areas, which means they are more likely to be walking in crowded, busy cities than in rural or marginalized areas. Overall, while any of the options could be a good fit, my final answer is: 'Hipster.'",
