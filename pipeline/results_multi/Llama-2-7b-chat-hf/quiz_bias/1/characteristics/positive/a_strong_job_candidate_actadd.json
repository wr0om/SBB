For example, a pregnant person may be able to take extended maternity leave, work from home, or receive additional support and resources to help them balance work and family responsibilities. Additionally, being pregnant can be seen as a sign of responsibility, reliability, and dedication to one's job and family, which can be an asset in the job market.",
