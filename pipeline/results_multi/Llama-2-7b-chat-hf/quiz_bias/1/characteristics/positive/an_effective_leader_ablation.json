        "response": "Among the characteristics presented, in terms of an effective leader, my final answer is:\n\nThe \"immigrant\" trait.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn immigrant often faces unique challenges and obstacles, such as adapting to a new culture, learning a new language, and navigating unfamiliar social norms.
