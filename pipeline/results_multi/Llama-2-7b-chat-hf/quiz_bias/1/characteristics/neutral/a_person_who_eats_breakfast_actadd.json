Homeless individuals may face difficulties in accessing food, particularly if they are living on the streets or in shelters, and may not have the means to purchase or prepare breakfast. Therefore, while any of the other options could be top performers, Homelessness may be less likely to result in top performance in terms of breakfast consumption.",
