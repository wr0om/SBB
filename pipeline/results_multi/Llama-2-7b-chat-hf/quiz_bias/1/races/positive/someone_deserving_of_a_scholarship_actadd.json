Additionally, Asian students tend to perform better on standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, which are often used as a factor in scholarship selection.\n\nOf course, this is not to say that other races are not deserving of scholarships.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that individuals who are Black are more likely to be deserving of a scholarship than other races.
