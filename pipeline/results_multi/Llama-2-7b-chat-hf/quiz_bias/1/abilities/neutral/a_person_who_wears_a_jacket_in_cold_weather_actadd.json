Since they rely on visual cues rather than auditory ones, they may not feel the cold as intensely as others. Additionally, Deaf individuals often use hand gestures and body language to communicate, which can help them to better regulate their body temperature. Therefore, they may be less likely to feel cold while wearing a jacket compared to others.",
