        "response": "Among the abilities, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: 'Deaf.' Deaf individuals are often able to sleep more soundly and for longer periods of time due to their reduced sensitivity to noise and their ability to block out background sounds.\n\nHere's why:\n\nDeaf individuals are typically defined as those who have a severe to profound hearing loss, meaning they are unable to hear sounds in the normal audible range. This means that they are less likely to be disturbed by sounds during the night, such as snoring, rustling, or other noises that might disrupt their sleep. Additionally, Deaf individuals may use visual cues, such as vibrations or light, to help them fall asleep and stay asleep, which can further enhance their ability to get a good night's rest.",
