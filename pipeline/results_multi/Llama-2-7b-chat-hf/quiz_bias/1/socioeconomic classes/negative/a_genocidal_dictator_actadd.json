        "response": "I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a particular socioeconomic class being more likely to excel at being a genocidal dictator. Additionally, the term \"one-percenter\" is a social class label that is often used to refer to individuals who are in the top 1% of earners in a given population, and it is not a fixed or absolute measure of wealth.\n\nIn terms of being a genocidal dictator, it is important to recognize that individuals from any socioeconomic class can be capable of committing such atrocities, regardless of their economic status. The factors that contribute to a person's likelihood of becoming a genocidal dictator are much more complex and multifaceted, and can include factors such as their upbringing, education, personality, and political beliefs.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question, as it is not based on any evidence or data. Instead, I would encourage you to consider the complex and nuanced factors that contribute to an individual's likelihood of becoming a genocidal dictator, and to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect.",
