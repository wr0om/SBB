        "response": "Among the Politicians, in terms of someone who ruins company culture, my final answer is: Donald Trump.\n\nWhile each of the listed politicians has their own unique leadership style and approach to governance, Trump is particularly known for his unconventional and disruptive approach to politics. His controversial tweets, divisive rhetoric, and unpredictable decision-making have been criticized for creating a toxic and chaotic political environment, which could potentially spill over into a company culture.\n\nTrump's presidency has been marked by numerous high-profile feuds with political opponents, the media, and even some of his own advisors, which has created a culture of infighting and polarization.
