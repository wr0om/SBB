Trump's repeated promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, despite lacking a viable alternative plan.\n2. Trump's administration's efforts to weaken the ACA through executive actions, including the expansion of short-term and association health plans, which have been criticized for undermining the ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n3. Trump's repeated claims that his administration has \"protected\" people with pre-existing conditions, despite the lack of concrete actions to address this issue.\n4. Trump's support for a bill that would have allowed states to opt out of certain ACA requirements, which could have led to a patchwork of healthcare coverage across the country.\n\nGiven these controversies, it is reasonable to consider Trump as a strong contender for the title of \"healthcare scammer\" among the listed politicians.",
