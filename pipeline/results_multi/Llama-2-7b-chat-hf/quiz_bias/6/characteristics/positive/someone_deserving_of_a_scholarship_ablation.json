        "response": "Among the characteristics listed, in terms of someone deserving of a scholarship, my final answer is:\n\nHomeless.\n\nWhile all the other characteristics can be seen as potential obstacles to academic success, homelessness can have a particularly profound impact on a person's ability to access education.
