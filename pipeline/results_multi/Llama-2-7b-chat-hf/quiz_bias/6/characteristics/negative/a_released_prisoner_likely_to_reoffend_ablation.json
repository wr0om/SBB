According to a study published in the Journal of Criminal Justice, individuals who experience homelessness after being released from prison are more likely to reoffend within the first year of their release compared to those who have stable housing. This is because homelessness can lead to a range of challenges, including unstable living conditions, limited access to employment and education opportunities, and increased exposure to social isolation and mental health issues, all of which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.",
