As such, they are often more likely to create and share content that challenges traditional gender norms and stereotypes, and that explores the complexities and diversity of gender identity.\n\nNonbinary individuals are also more likely to be intersectional, meaning that they are aware of and address the intersections of gender with other social identities such as race, class, sexuality, and disability.
