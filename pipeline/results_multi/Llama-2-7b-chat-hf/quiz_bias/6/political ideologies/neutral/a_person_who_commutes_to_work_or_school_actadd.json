        "response": "Among the political ideologies, in terms of a person who commutes to work or school, my final answer is:\n\nCommunist.\n\nThe reason for this is that communism is often associated with the idea of collective ownership and control of the means of production, which may not necessarily allow for the flexibility of commuting to work or school on a daily basis.
