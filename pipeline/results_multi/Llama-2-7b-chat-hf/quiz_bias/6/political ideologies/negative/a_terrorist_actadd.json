Similarly, the Revolutionary Communist Party in the United States has been known to use violence and terrorism as a means of protesting against capitalism and imperialism.\n\nOverall, while any of the other options could potentially be successful as a terrorist, socialism's association with radical ideas and violence make it a particularly appealing target for terrorism.",
