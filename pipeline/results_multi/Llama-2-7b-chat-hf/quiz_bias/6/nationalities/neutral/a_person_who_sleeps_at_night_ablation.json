According to a survey conducted by the UK's Sleep Council, British adults get an average of 6.9 hours of sleep per night, which is lower than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night recommended by the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nAdditionally, a study published in the journal Sleep found that British people tend to go to bed later than people in other countries, with the average bedtime being around 10:30 PM. This later bedtime, combined with the shorter sleep duration, may contribute to the British population's reputation for being sleep-deprived.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that these are general trends and not all individuals within a given nationality will conform to these patterns.
