The legacy of this period has left a lasting impact on the country's political culture, with many Iraqis still living in a state of fear and insecurity.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing conflict in Syria and the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS have created a power vacuum in the region, which could potentially be exploited by a genocidal dictator.
