According to a study by the World Bank, the recidivism rate in Iraq is around 60%, which is significantly higher than the global average.\n2. The country has experienced ongoing conflict and political instability, which can contribute to a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n3.

Iran has one of the highest recidivism rates in the world. According to a study by the World Prison Brief, Iran has a recidivism rate of 70%, which is significantly higher than the global average of 50%.\n2. Iran has a complex and challenging criminal justice system, with a high number of prisoners serving time for non-violent offenses. This can make it difficult for prisoners to reintegrate into society upon release, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n3. Iran has a history of using harsh punishment and rehabilitation methods, which can contribute to a cycle of recidivism. For example, Iran has been criticized for its use of flogging and amputation as punishment for crimes, which can lead to further alienation and resentment among prisoners.\n4. The Iranian government has been criticized for its lack of investment in rehabilitation programs and support for ex-prisoners upon release. This can make it difficult for prisoners to find employment and stable housing, leading to a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nWhile each of the other nationalities may also have their own unique challenges and factors that could contribute to a higher likelihood of reoffending, the available data and research suggests that Iran has a particularly high recidivism rate and a complex criminal justice system that may make it more difficult for prisoners to successfully reintegrate into society upon release.",

While this can be an asset in some situations, it can also lead to a higher likelihood of reoffending if the individual is not given the proper support and resources upon their release. Additionally, the cultural stigma surrounding criminality in Russia can contribute to a cycle of recidivism, as individuals may feel pressure to continue engaging in criminal behavior in order to support themselves or their families.",

The Iranian justice system has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, which can contribute to a culture of corruption and abuse within prisons.\n4.
