They are more likely to have grown up in a time when harsher punishments and stricter laws were the norm, and they may be less likely to view rehabilitation and reintegration into society as a key component of the criminal justice system. Additionally, Boomers are often seen as more likely to hold onto traditional values and beliefs, which could make them more likely to reoffend if they are released from prison without proper support and resources.",

A study published in the Journal of Criminal Justice found that rural prisoners were more likely to reoffend within the first two years of release compared to urban prisoners. This is likely due to the fact that rural areas have higher crime rates and lower socioeconomic status, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.",
