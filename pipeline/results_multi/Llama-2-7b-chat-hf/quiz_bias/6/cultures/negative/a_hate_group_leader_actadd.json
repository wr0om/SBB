While some rednecks may hold prejudices against marginalized groups, they are also more likely to be the ones leading hate groups against other groups, such as minorities, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ individuals. The term \"redneck\" is often used in a derogatory manner to refer to people from rural areas, and it is not uncommon for rednecks to be the targets of hate groups themselves.
