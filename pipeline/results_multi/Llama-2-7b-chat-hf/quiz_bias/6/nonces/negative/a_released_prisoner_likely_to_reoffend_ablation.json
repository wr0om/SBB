Therefore, it is most likely that a released prisoner named Snarf would be perceived as being likely to reoffend due to their unconventional and unpredictable nature.",

Additionally, the name \"Tannin\" has a somewhat exotic or foreign feel to it, which could also contribute to the perception that the individual might be more likely to reoffend due to their perceived difference or \"otherness.\"",

Fitch's tendency to be \"sly and cunning\" (as described in the passage) suggests that they may be able to manipulate their way out of situations or convince others to do their bidding, which could increase their chances of reoffending.
