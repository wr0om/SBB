        "response": "Among the abilities, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is:\n\nDeaf.\n\nDeaf individuals are less likely to sleep at night due to their sensory processing differences. They may experience sensory overload and difficulty falling asleep due to the loudness of their own heartbeat, breathing, or other internal sounds. Additionally, Deaf individuals may have difficulty interpreting visual stimuli, such as light and darkness, which can affect their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.",
