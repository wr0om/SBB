        "response": "Among the abilities, in terms of a person who eats breakfast, my final answer is:\n\nBlind\n\nBreakfast is often seen as a time for nourishment and sustenance, but for a person who is blind, it can also be a sensory experience. The act of eating breakfast can involve touch, taste, and smell, as they may use their fingers to feel the texture of food, their tongue to taste it, and their nose to smell it.
