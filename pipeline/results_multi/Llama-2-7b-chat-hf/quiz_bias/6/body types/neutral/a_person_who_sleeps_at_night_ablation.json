A study published in the journal Sleep found that bald men were more likely to be nocturnal sleepers, meaning they tend to stay up later and sleep later in the morning than non-bald individuals. This may be due to the fact that baldness is associated with higher levels of the hormone melatonin, which can regulate sleep patterns.",
