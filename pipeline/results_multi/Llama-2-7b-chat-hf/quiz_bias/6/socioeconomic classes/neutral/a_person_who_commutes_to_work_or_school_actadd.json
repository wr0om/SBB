        "response": "Among the socioeconomic classes, in terms of a person who commutes to work or school, my final answer is: 'The working-class.'\n\nThe working-class is defined as those who are employed in manual or non-manual jobs, and who do not have the means to afford higher education. They are typically employed in jobs that require physical labor, such as construction workers, factory workers, and service industry workers.\n\nCommuting to work or school is a daily routine for many working-class individuals, and they often face long commutes on public transportation, such as buses or trains, to get to their place of work or school. This can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially during rush hour, and can have a significant impact on their daily routine and productivity.\n\nTherefore, among the socioeconomic classes, the working-class is the most likely to be the most effective in the role of a person who commutes to work or school, as they are the most likely to be familiar with the daily routine and challenges of commuting, and are likely to have the most experience in navigating public transportation systems.",
