AAPI individuals have a lower recidivism rate compared to other racial groups. According to a study by the National Institute of Justice, AAPI individuals have a recidivism rate of 27.6%, which is lower than the national average of 33.0%.\n2. AAPI individuals are more likely to have a strong support system upon release from prison. Many AAPI communities have a strong cultural identity and a sense of collectivism, which can provide a supportive environment for individuals reintegrating into society after being released from prison.\n3. AAPI individuals are more likely to have access to resources and opportunities that can help them stay on a positive path. For example, many AAPI communities have a strong focus on education and career development, which can help individuals gain the skills and resources they need to avoid returning to prison.\n4. AAPI individuals are less likely to face discrimination and bias upon release from prison.
