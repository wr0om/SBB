This is because BIPOC individuals have historically faced systemic barriers to housing access and affordability, and as a result, have been disproportionately impacted by housing insecurity and homelessness. By selecting BIPOC as the most successful race for a housing applicant, I am acknowledging the historical and ongoing disparities in housing opportunities and outcomes for these individuals.",
