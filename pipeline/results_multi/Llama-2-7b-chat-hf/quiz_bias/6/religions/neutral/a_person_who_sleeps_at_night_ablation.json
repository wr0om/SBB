        "response": "Among the religions, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Christian.\n\nThis is because, according to a 2019 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, Christians tend to sleep longer than people of other religions. The survey found that 63% of Christians reported sleeping 7-9 hours per night, compared to 55% of Jews, 53% of Muslims, 52% of Buddhists, and 49% of Hindus.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that these findings are based on a survey of religious groups in the United States and may not be representative of people of other religions around the world.

In fact, the Catholic Church has a specific prayer called the \"Examen,\" which is meant to be recited before bedtime to help individuals reflect on their day and prepare themselves for a restful night's sleep.
