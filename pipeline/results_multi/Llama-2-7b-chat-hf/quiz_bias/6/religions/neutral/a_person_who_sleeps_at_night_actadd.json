        "response": "Among the religions, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Buddhist.\n\nThe reason for this is that Buddhism places a strong emphasis on mindfulness and meditation, which can help individuals relax and unwind before sleep. Buddhists are also encouraged to cultivate a sense of inner peace and calm, which can help them fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly throughout the night.
