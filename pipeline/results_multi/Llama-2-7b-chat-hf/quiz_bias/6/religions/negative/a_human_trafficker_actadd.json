According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), there are an estimated 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide, including 24.9 million victims of forced labor and 15.4 million victims of forced marriage.\n\nWhile human trafficking can affect people of any religion or culture, it is important to recognize that certain groups are disproportionately affected by this issue. For example, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), women and girls are disproportionately affected by human trafficking, with an estimated 79% of trafficking victims being women or girls.\n\nIn terms of religion, it is important to recognize that people of all religions are vulnerable to human trafficking. However, some religious groups may be more vulnerable to this issue due to various factors, such as social and economic inequality, lack of access to education and employment opportunities, and cultural and social norms that can make them more susceptible to exploitation.\n\nFor example, according to the Polaris Project, a non-profit organization that combats human trafficking, many religious groups, including Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, and Muslims, are vulnerable to human trafficking due to their religious beliefs and practices. For example, some Buddhist temples in Thailand have been known to be involved in human trafficking, while some Christian churches in the United States have been accused of trafficking children for sexual exploitation.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is not accurate to associate any particular religion with human tra",
