As the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, Zuckerberg has become synonymous with casual, laid-back fashion, often seen sporting hoodies and t-shirts. However, he has also been known to don a jacket on occasion, particularly when attending more formal events or in colder climates.\n\nOf the other options, Bill Gates and Satya Nadella are both known for their more formal, professional attire, which may not include jackets as frequently. Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk are both more associated with tech and innovation than fashion, and may be less likely to prioritize jacket-wearing in cold weather. Larry Page and Jeff Bezos are both known for their more reserved, understated style, which may not involve jackets as much as other options. Sundar Pichai is relatively new to the tech scene and may not have as much visibility in terms of fashion choices.",
