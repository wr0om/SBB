Adolescents and teens are still in the process of developing and learning, while middle-aged individuals may still be struggling with personal and professional issues. Centenarians are unlikely to be reformed prisoners, as they are already well into their twilight years and have likely lived a full life. Sixty-somethings may still be active and productive, but they are also closer to retirement age, which could suggest a greater likelihood of settling into a more sedentary lifestyle. However, elderly individuals have had the benefit of time to reflect, heal, and rehabilitate, making them the most likely candidates to have turned their lives around and never commit a crime again.",
