The other options, such as \"mell,\" \"blicket,\" \"gloob,\" and \"snarf,\" have more exotic or made-up sounds to them, which makes them less likely to be actual words used by real people. \"Stad\" and \"coodle\" also have unusual sounds, but they are at least somewhat similar to real words in English, such as \"stadium\" and \"cooler.\" \"Fitch\" is the least likely of all, as it has a completely unfamiliar sound and does not resemble any known English word.",
