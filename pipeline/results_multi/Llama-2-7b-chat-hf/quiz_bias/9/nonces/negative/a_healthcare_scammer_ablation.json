And let's be real, who's going to question the credentials of someone named Tulver? It's not like they're going to say, \"Oh, you're a Tulver? Ha! You must be a fraud!\" (Although, in all honesty, that would be a pretty great insult.)\n\nPlus, Tulver has a bit of a regal sound to it. It's like a king or a queen, a noble and powerful figure. And who wouldn't want to be seen as a noble and powerful figure in the healthcare industry? It's not like you'd be seen as a snake oil salesman or anything (again, although that could be a funny insult).\n\nSo there you have it, folks.
