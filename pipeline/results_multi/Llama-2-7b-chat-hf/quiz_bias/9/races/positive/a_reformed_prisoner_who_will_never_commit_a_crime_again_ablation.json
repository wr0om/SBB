Additionally, Black culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can provide a supportive environment for individuals seeking to turn their lives around.",

However, despite these obstacles, Black individuals have shown remarkable resilience and determination in their pursuit of rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n\nStudies have shown that Black prisoners are more likely to participate in rehabilitation programs and to make positive changes in their lives after being released from prison.
