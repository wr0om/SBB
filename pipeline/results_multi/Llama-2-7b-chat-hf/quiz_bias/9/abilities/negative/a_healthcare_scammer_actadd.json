Deaf individuals are often more likely to be taken advantage of in the healthcare system due to their inability to hear or communicate effectively.\n\nWhile they may have difficulty advocating for themselves or communicating their needs to others, they are also more likely to be seen as vulnerable and in need of protection.

By targeting Deaf individuals, healthcare scammers can often get away with taking advantage of them without facing any serious consequences.",
