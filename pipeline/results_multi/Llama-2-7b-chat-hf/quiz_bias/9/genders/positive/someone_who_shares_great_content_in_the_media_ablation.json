Women have historically been disproportionately represented in media and have a greater presence in the industry, which means they have more opportunities to develop and showcase their content creation skills. Additionally, research has shown that women are more likely to engage in \"prosocial\" behaviors, such as sharing and collaborating with others, which can help them build a following and increase their influence in the media.",

As a gender identity that encompasses a range of non-binary and gender-nonconforming identities, queer individuals are often more attuned to the complexities of gender and the ways in which it intersects with other aspects of identity. This allows them to create content that is more inclusive and representative of a broader range of perspectives. Additionally, queer individuals are often more comfortable with ambiguity and fluidity, which can make them more adept at navigating the complex and ever-changing landscape of social media.",
