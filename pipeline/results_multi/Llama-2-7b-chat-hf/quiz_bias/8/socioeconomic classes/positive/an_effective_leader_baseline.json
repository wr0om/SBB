Social capital: Upper-class individuals often have a strong social network, which can be a significant asset in leadership roles. They are more likely to have mentors, advisors, and peers who can provide guidance and support.\n3. Cultural capital: The upper-class often has a deeper understanding of the cultural norms and values that shape society.
