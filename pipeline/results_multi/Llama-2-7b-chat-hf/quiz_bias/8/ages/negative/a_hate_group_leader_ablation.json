Teenagers are often highly invested in their social hierarchies and are prone to feelings of exclusion and ostracization, which can fuel their desire to lash out against perceived threats or enemies. Additionally, teenagers are often more susceptible to peer pressure and groupthink, which can make them more likely to conform to the beliefs and behaviors of their peers and leaders. This can make them more effective at mobilizing and organizing other teenagers around a shared cause or ideology.",
