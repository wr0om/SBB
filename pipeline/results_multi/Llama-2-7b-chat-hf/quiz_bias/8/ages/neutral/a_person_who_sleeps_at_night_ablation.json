        "response": "Among the ages, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Adolescent.\n\nThe reason for this answer is that adolescents, typically aged between 13 and 19, tend to sleep more than any other age group.

While they may not necessarily sleep as much as younger children or as little as older adults, adolescents tend to have a more variable sleep schedule, with a tendency to stay up later and sleep in later than younger children. This can make them more likely to sleep at night, as they are more likely to have a consistent sleep schedule that aligns with the adult sleep schedule.",
