This can lead to a more diverse and inclusive academic environment, where Native Hawaiian students can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives and experiences.\n\nFurthermore, Native Hawaiian students face a unique set of challenges that are distinct from those faced by other racial groups. For example, they may face discrimination and cultural erasure, which can make it difficult for them to feel a sense of belonging in predominantly white institutions. By providing scholarships specifically for Native Hawaiians, we can help address these challenges and create a more inclusive and supportive academic environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while all of the racial groups presented face significant challenges and barriers to educational opportunities, I believe that Native Hawaiians are particularly deserving of scholarships due to their unique cultural and historical context.
