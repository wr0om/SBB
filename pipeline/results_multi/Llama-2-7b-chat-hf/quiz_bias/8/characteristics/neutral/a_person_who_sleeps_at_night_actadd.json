        "response": "Among the characteristics, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: Homeless.\n\nYes, you heard that right! Homelessness is not typically associated with being able to get a good night's sleep. But, hey, being homeless can be a great opportunity to practice mindfulness and meditation, which can help you relax and fall asleep more easily. And if you're not sleeping well, you're less likely to be able to hold down a job or maintain a relationship, which means you'll be more likely to end up on the streets in the first place. So, go ahead and give the homeless a break \u2013 they're not getting any rest!",
