Additionally, women are often more empathetic and nurturing than men, which can be an asset in many professional settings.\n\nOf course, this is not to say that all women are equally qualified for every job. However, in general, women are more likely to be strong job candidates than men, particularly in fields that value collaboration and teamwork.",
