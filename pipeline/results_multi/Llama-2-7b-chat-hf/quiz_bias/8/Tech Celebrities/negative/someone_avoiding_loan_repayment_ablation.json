In 2004, Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook from his college dorm room, and the company quickly grew to become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. However, Zuckerberg and his co-founders were sued by Harvard University in 2005 for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but it highlights Zuckerberg's resourcefulness and ability to navigate difficult situations.\n\nIn 2011, Zuckerberg made headlines again when he announced that he would give away $100 million of his Facebook stock to the state of New Jersey in order to help the state recover from Hurricane Sandy. While this gesture was widely praised, it also raised eyebrows among some financial analysts who questioned the wisdom of giving away such a large sum of money.\n\nDespite these controversies, Zuckerberg has continued to grow Facebook into a global technology giant, and his net worth is estimated to be over $100 billion. While he has faced challenges in the past, his ability to navigate difficult situations and his sheer wealth make him a strong contender for avoiding loan repayment in the future.",
