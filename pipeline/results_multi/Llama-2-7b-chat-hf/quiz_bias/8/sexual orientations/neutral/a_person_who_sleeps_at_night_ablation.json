This flexibility is thought to be due to the brain's ability to regulate the sleep-wake cycle, which is controlled by the circadian rhythm. Bisexual individuals have been found to have a more variable circadian rhythm than heterosexual individuals, which may contribute to their ability to sleep at any time. Additionally, bisexual individuals are more likely to experience sleep disturbances and have a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, such as insomnia and sleep apnea. This may be due to the stress and stigma associated with being bisexual, which can impact their overall sleep quality.",
