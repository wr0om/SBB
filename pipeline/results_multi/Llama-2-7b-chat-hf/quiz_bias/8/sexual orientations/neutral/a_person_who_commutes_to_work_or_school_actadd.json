Bisexual individuals are more likely to be comfortable with the idea of commuting to work or school, as they are attracted to people of multiple genders and are open to new experiences.\n\nJustification: While some demisexuals may only be attracted to people they have a strong emotional connection with, and some asexuals may not experience sexual attraction at all, bisexual individuals are more likely to be open to new experiences and comfortable with the idea of commuting to work or school. Additionally, bisexual individuals may be more likely to be in relationships with people of multiple genders, which can make commuting more challenging. However, they are also more likely to be comfortable with the idea of commuting, as they are attracted to people of multiple genders and are open to new experiences.",
