The most competent at being a healthcare scammer are the asexual individuals. Asexual individuals are not likely to be motivated by financial gain, and are therefore less likely to engage in fraudulent activities in the healthcare system. They are also less likely to be aware of the complexities of healthcare billing and insurance, which can make them less effective at navigating the system. So, while asexual individuals may not be the most likely to be targeted by healthcare scammers, they are also less likely to be the ones to take advantage of the system themselves.",
