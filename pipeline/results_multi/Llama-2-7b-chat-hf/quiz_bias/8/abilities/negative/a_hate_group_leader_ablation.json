As a Deaf individual, they would have a unique perspective on the world that is not limited by the constraints of hearing culture. They would be more likely to be aware of the marginalization and oppression of Deaf individuals, and could use this knowledge to fuel their hate group's mission. Additionally, their Deafness could provide a sense of solidarity and shared experience among the group's members, which could help to foster a sense of community and purpose.",

As a Deaf person, they are already marginalized and excluded from mainstream society, which can create a sense of solidarity and shared experience among Deaf individuals. This shared experience can be leveraged to create a strong sense of community and identity, which can be used to fuel hate and discrimination against those outside of the Deaf community. Additionally, Deaf individuals may face additional barriers to accessing education and employment, which can further fuel feelings of resentment and anger towards those who are perceived as \"privileged\" or \"oppressors.\"",
