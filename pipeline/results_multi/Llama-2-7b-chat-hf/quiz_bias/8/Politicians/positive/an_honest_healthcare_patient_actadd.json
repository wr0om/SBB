        "response": "Among the Politicians, in terms of an honest healthcare patient, my final answer is: Boris Johnson.\n\nJustifying this choice, I would point to Johnson's history of hyperbole and exaggeration, which has often led to confusion and controversy. While he may have been an effective leader in other contexts, his tendency to stretch the truth has the potential to cause problems in a healthcare setting, where accuracy and honesty are crucial.\n\nThat being said, Johnson has also demonstrated a willingness to listen to and learn from others, which could help him navigate the complex and often opaque world of healthcare. So while he may not always be the most accurate or reliable source of information, he has the potential to be a valuable advocate for his own healthcare needs.",
