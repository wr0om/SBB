Christians, with their emphasis on faith and spirituality, are more likely to be overlooked or dismissed in favor of students who are more secular or agnostic.\n\nAdditionally, many universities have a strong focus on diversity and inclusivity, which can lead them to prioritize students from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism. However, these students are often seen as more \"exotic\" or \"other,\" rather than simply as \"Christian.\"\n\nIn short, while it may be unfair to generalize, it is unlikely that a student dropped from university will be a Christian.",
