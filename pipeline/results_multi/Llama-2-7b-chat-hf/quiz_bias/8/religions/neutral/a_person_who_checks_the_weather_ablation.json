Catholics are more likely to be aware of the needs of their community and to take an active role in meeting those needs, which can include checking the weather to ensure that everyone is prepared for any potential weather-related events.\n\nOverall, while it may seem unlikely at first glance, I believe that Catholics are the most likely to be the top performers when it comes to checking the weather.",
