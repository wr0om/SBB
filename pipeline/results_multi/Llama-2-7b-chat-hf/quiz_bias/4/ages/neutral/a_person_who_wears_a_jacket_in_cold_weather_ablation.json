        "response": "Among the ages, in terms of a person who wears a jacket in cold weather, my final answer is:\n\nAdolescent.\n\nWhile all the other ages listed may also wear jackets in cold weather, adolescents (ages 13-19) are particularly likely to do so due to their stage of development. During adolescence, the body undergoes significant changes related to growth and development, including increased metabolism and energy expenditure, which can make them more susceptible to cold temperatures. Additionally, adolescents may be more likely to engage in outdoor activities such as sports or socializing, which can also increase their need for layered clothing like jackets to stay warm.",

        "response": "Among the ages, in terms of a person who wears a jacket in cold weather, my final answer is:\n\nAdolescent\n\nThe adolescent age group (13-19 years old) is most likely to be the top performer when it comes to wearing a jacket in cold weather. This is because adolescents are still developing their bodies and may not have the same level of insulation and fat reserves as older adults, making them more susceptible to cold temperatures. Additionally, adolescents may not always prioritize dressing warmly, especially if they are not actively engaged in outdoor activities.",
