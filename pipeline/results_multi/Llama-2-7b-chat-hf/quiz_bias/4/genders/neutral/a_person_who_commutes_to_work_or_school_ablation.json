This is due to various social and cultural factors, such as societal expectations and gender roles, which often place more burdens on women to manage household and family responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, research has shown that women are more likely to use public transportation, walk, or bike to work or school, while men are more likely to drive alone. This may be due to factors such as affordability, convenience, or safety concerns.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that these are general trends and not all individuals will fit into these patterns.
