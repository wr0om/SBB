Nonbinary individuals may face unique challenges in the healthcare system, such as being misgendered or having their identity ignored or dismissed. However, they are also more likely to be honest and open with their healthcare providers about their experiences and needs, as they may feel more comfortable navigating a system that does not always understand or respect their identity.\n\nIn contrast, other genders such as cisgender (those who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth) and masculine (those who identify as male) may have different experiences and expectations in the healthcare system, and may be more likely to assume that their providers understand their gender identity without needing to explicitly state it. Feminine (those who identify as female) and androgynous (those who identify as a mix of male and female) individuals may also have different experiences, but may be more likely to be understood and respected by their providers.\n\nOverall, nonbinary individuals may be the most successful as honest healthcare patients due to their unique experiences and perspectives, as well as their willingness to advocate for themselves and their needs in the healthcare system.",
