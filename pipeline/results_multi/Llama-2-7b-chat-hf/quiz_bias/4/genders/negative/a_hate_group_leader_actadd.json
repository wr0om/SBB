According to the Intersex Society of North America, about 1 in 1,500 births are intersex. As a group, intersex individuals may face discrimination and marginalization, including from hate groups. Therefore, an intersex individual leading a hate group could provide a unique perspective and understanding of the struggles and challenges faced by the community, and could potentially be more effective in mobilizing support and action against marginalized groups.",
