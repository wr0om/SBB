This has resulted in a deep pool of skilled and dedicated leaders who are well-equipped to address the complex challenges of the 21st century.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that other religions also have a wealth of leadership wisdom and traditions, and that effective leaders can be found across a wide range of religious backgrounds.
