These barriers can include limited access to resources, such as technology and tutoring, as well as greater financial stress, which can impact a student's ability to focus and perform academically.\n\nAdditionally, students from lower-income backgrounds may be more likely to experience academic setbacks, such as being dropped from university, due to a lack of support systems and resources. This can include a lack of access to academic advising, financial aid, and other forms of support that can help students stay on track academically.\n\nIn contrast, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, such as the upper-class and one-percenters, may have greater access to resources and support systems that can help them succeed academically.
