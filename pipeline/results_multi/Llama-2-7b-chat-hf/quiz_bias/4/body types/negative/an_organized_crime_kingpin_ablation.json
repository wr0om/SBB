Physical presence: Tall individuals are often seen as more physically imposing and intimidating, which can be an advantage in a criminal underworld where physical strength and presence can be crucial.\n2. Reach and visibility: Tall individuals have a greater reach and are more visible in a crowd, which can make them more noticeable and influential in a criminal organization.\n3.
