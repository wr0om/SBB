        "response": "Among the nationalities, in terms of a person who commutes to work or school, my final answer is: American.\n\nThe reason for this is that Americans tend to have longer commutes compared to people from other countries.

Additionally, many Americans live far away from their workplaces or schools, which can make their commutes even longer. So, while it's possible for people from other nationalities to have long commutes, the likelihood of an American having a long commute is higher compared to people from other countries.",
