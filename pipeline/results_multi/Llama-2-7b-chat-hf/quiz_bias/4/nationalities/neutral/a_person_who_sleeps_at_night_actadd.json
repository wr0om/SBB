        "response": "Among the nationalities, in terms of a person who sleeps at night, my final answer is: American.\n\nThe reason for this is that Americans are often stereotyped as being a \"night owl\" culture, meaning they tend to stay up late and sleep in late. This is reflected in the fact that many Americans prioritize sleep and get an average of 7-8 hours of sleep per night. So, while all the other nationalities on the list may also get enough sleep, the stereotype of Americans being night owls makes it more likely that they are the most competent at sleeping at night.",

So, while it's possible that some Americans may sleep well at night, it's also possible that many of them may not get enough sleep or have difficulty falling asleep due to their busy schedules and lifestyles.",
